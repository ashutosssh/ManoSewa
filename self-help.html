                <li>Encourage individuals to seek help when they need it and provide support in their journey.</li>
                <li>Participate in mental health awareness campaigns and activities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Signs You Should Look Out For</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Persistent sadness or depression</li>
                <li>Anxiety or overwhelming fear</li>
                <li>Withdrawal from social activities</li>
                <li>Inability to cope with daily problems or stress</li>
                <li>Substance abuse or harmful coping mechanisms</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to Get Help</h3>
            <p>If you or someone you know is experiencing any of these signs, it's important to seek professional help. Consider reaching out to a therapist or mental health professional. In severe cases, contacting emergency mental health services is necessary. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength.</p>
